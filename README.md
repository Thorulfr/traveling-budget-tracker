# Budget Tracker for Traveling

## Description

<!-- #1 Fan is a collaborative project created as part of the University of Utah's full-stack developer bootcamp. It is intended to serve as a one-stop shop for music lovers to listen to and discover new music, save their favorite artists and albums, find upcoming concerts (for a specific artist or venue or the user's general location), and catalogue a user's attended concerts.

The entire application – both front- and back-end – was built from the ground up using the below user story, acceptance criteria, APIs, and languages. -->

## User Story

```
AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
```
